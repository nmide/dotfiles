I find this a bit more pleasant to my eyes.  Try the original first, though.\n\n## From the original README:\n\nDuoTone dark uses only 2 hues (blue & gold) and 7 shades in total. It __tones down__ less important parts (like punctuation and brackets) and highlights only the __important__ ones. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.\n\n<img alt=\"CSS in DuoTone blue dark\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smlombardi/duotone-blue-dark/master/scss.png\">\n\n<img alt=\"HTML in DuoTone blue dark\"  src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smlombardi/duotone-blue-dark/master/html.png\">\n\n\n### Currently tested and optimized for these languages:\n\n- C\n- CSS\n- CoffeeScript\n- GF Markdown\n- Go\n- HTML\n- JSON\n- (La-)TeX\n- Less\n- Perl\n- PHP\n- Python\n- Ruby\n- SASS\n- SCSS\n- XML\n- YAML\n\nMore optimization to come..\n\n> ps.
