Original README by [simurai](https://github.com/simurai/duotone-light-syntax).\n\n![DuoTone light blue](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsangkenneth/duotone-light-blue-syntax/master/duotone-light-blue.png)\n\nDuoTone light blue uses only 2 hues (blue & gold) and has 7 shades in total. It __tones down__ less important parts (like punctuation and brackets) and highlights only the __important__ ones. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.\n\n![CSS in DuoTone light blue](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsangkenneth/duotone-light-blue-syntax/master/css.png)\n\n![HTML in DuoTone light blue](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsangkenneth/duotone-light-blue-syntax/master/html.png)\n\n> The font in the screenshot is `Source Code Pro`. You can download it from https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro.\n\n## Language support\n\nDuoTone themes are optimized for many languages:\n\n> C, Clojure, CoffeeScript, C#, CSS, GF Markdown, Go, Haskell, HTML, Java, JavaScript, JSON, Less, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, SASS, SCSS, Stylus, XML, YAML...\n\nMore optimizations to come. See the list of [all languages](/styles/languages).\n\n\n## Variations\n\nSee other [DuoTone themes](https://atom.io/themes/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=keyword:duotone). Or at least the ones that have the `duotone` keyword added.\n\n\n### Issues and contributing\n\nIf you would like to create a new __Issue__ or __PR__, please do so in:\n\n- __this repo__ if it's about __color__ changes, like in `colors.less` or `syntax-variables.less`.\n- __[DuoTone master template](https://github.com/simurai/duotone-syntax)__ if it's about __everything else__, like in improving language support. Changes will trickle down into this theme too.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/tsangkenneth/duotone-light-blue-syntax/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/tsangkenneth/duotone-light-blue-syntax#readme","_id":"duotone-light-blue-syntax@1.0.1","_shasum":"82a3424bd5c40599fec87932f151edb9eb4d798e","_resolved":"file:../d-116516-25593-el7i8e/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116516-25593-el7i8e/package.tgz"}
