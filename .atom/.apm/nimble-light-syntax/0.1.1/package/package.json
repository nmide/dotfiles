CoffeeScript and Ruby should also be good, but I've haven't tested them very extensively just yet.\n\nFont in the screenshots is Mozilla's terrific [Fira Mono](https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/). It's included in [braver](atom.io/users/braver)'s [fonts](atom.io/packages/fonts) package.\n\nI think this theme looks really great with the One Light UI theme that ships with Atom.\n\n![js-screenshot](https://github.com/blaqbern/nimble-light-syntax/blob/master/js.png?raw=true)\n\n![gfm-screenshot](https://github.com/blaqbern/nimble-light-syntax/blob/master/gfm.png?raw=true)\n\nThanks for stopping by!\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/blaqbern/nimble-light-syntax/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/blaqbern/nimble-light-syntax#readme","_id":"nimble-light-syntax@0.1.1","_shasum":"e4ba7302a3c25eccb03f423016db0c0dfbaaf01e","_resolved":"file:../d-116413-6781-18xq7dv/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116413-6781-18xq7dv/package.tgz"}
