# An Old Hope (Light)

Light Atom theme inspired by [a galaxy far far away...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nick-f/an-old-hope-light-syntax-atom/master/a-new-hope.jpg) It is an elegant theme for a more civilised age.

Based on [An Old Hope](https://atom.io/themes/an-old-hope-syntax) by [Jesse Leite](https://github.com/JesseLeite)

## UI Integration

This theme best integrates with Atom's [One Light UI](https://atom.io/themes/one-light-ui).  By default, UI is left untouched.  If you want the modified UI (as shown in the screenshot below) for better colour matching between UI syntax theme, add the following line to your Init Script and reload Atom.

```coffee
document.body.classList.add('an-old-hope-light-modify-ui')
```
