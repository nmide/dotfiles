Broadcast Color Scheme
======================

Custom color scheme for [Atom](http://atom.io), [Terminal](http://bit.ly/1f0P1dQ), [iTerm](http://www.iterm2.com), [TextMate](http://macromates.com) and [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com/). Inspired by the great RailsCasts Theme by Ryan Bates [http://railscasts.com](http://railscasts.com).

Support for [PHPStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) and [VIM](http://www.vim.org/) will be added within near future.
