# DuoTone light blue

A double-hue syntax theme for Atom, based on [DuoTone light](https://github.com/simurai/duotone-light-syntax) by [simurai](https://github.com/simurai) and the color shifts in [DuoTone blue dark](https://github.com/smlombardi/duotone-blue-dark) by [smlombardi](https://github.com/smlombardi). Original README by [simurai](https://github.com/simurai/duotone-light-syntax).

DuoTone light blue uses only 2 hues (blue & gold) and has 7 shades in total. It __tones down__ less important parts (like punctuation and brackets) and highlights only the __important__ ones. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.
