# EnvyGeeks Light Theme

EnvyGeeks light theme uses a simple palet built from the default Ubuntu/Gnome
color palet for terminals.  It is not special, the colors were not picked out
by me, they were simply snatched and stolen so my terminal would match my
IDE and so forth, so that going between VIM and Atom did not look super nasty.
