# nimble-light-syntax theme

A unique syntax theme that, despite its funky color palette, is actually quite comfortable to work in, even for long sessions.

Optimized for JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JSON and gfm. CoffeeScript and Ruby should also be good, but I've haven't tested them very extensively just yet.

Font in the screenshots is Mozilla's terrific [Fira Mono](https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/). It's included in [braver](atom.io/users/braver)'s [fonts](atom.io/packages/fonts) package.

I think this theme looks really great with the One Light UI theme that ships with Atom.
